    <p>
      300g <br> beetroot, <br> peeled
      50g <br> butter
      1 <br> small <br> onion, <br> 1 <br> small <br> carrot, <br> 1 <br> stick <br> of <br> celery, <br> 1 <br> small <br> leek, <br> all <br> peeled <br> where <br> necessary <br> and <br> cut <br> into <br> small <br> dice <br> or <br> rings
      2 <br> grains <br> allspice
      ½ <br> bay <br> leaf
      1.5l <br> gelatinous <br> beef <br> stock
      2 <br> medium <br> floury <br> potatoes, <br> eg <br> Maris <br> Piper, <br> peeled <br> and <br> cut <br> into <br> small <br> dice
      ½ <br> small <br> cabbage, <br> shredded
      4 <br> cloves <br> garlic, <br> peeled <br> and <br> crushed
      2 <br> tbsp <br> cider <br> vinegar
      1 <br> tsp <br> sugar
      ½ <br> tsp <br> ground <br> black <br> pepper
      Sour <br> cream <br> and <br> fresh <br> dill, <br> to <br> serve
  </p>
    <em>Cut ¾ of the peeled <br> beetroot <br> into small dice (you may want to wear rubber gloves to do this) and set the rest aside. Melt the butter in a large pan, and then soften the onion over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.

Add the <br> carrot, <br> leek, <br> celery, <br> diced beetroot,<br>  allspice and bay leaf and stir well to coat with butter. Cook for another 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry. Meanwhile, grate the remaining <br>beetroot<br>.

Pour in the rest of the stock and the <br>potatoes<br> and simmer for 15 minutes, then add the <br>cabbage<br>, garlic<br>and grated <br>beetroot<br>. Cook until all the vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes).

Add the vinegar, sugar, pepper and a pinch of salt and taste. Add a little more of any of these if necessary, then serve with a dollop of sour cream, a sprig of <br>dill<br>, and some Polish bread on the side.</em>
